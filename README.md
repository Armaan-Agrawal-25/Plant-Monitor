Plant Monitor: Designed and developed a “Plant Monitor” application and device that provides statistics such as the amount of light a plant is receiving, the temperature of the plant’s surroundings, and the amount of time until the plant needs to be watered, in order to ensure a plant is well-taken care of and not neglected. 
- Wrote a Javascript program that records and displays the mentioned statistics.
- Created a physical prototype with 3D-printed parts where a Circuit Playground could be attached.
